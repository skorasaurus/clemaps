to view them: http://skorasaurus.github.io/clemaps/



based off osm-bright. 

Branches contain different styles. 


Walking in Memphis: 
- loud. inspired by the memphis art movement; the Double Dare TV show. A reimagining of what map I would design if I were 11 years old right now. Highlights playgrounds, schools ..... VERY early work in progress. 


Citydirt: 
- what I imagined a 1970s newspaper would have as a basemap in color. 

Mellow: 
- subdued base map, styled within mapbox.com
